## 4. Tax Optimization Strategy

### **Zero Tax Approach**:

- **ELSS Mutual Funds** (optional): Additional tax-saving equity exposure with 3-year lock-in
- **Total Tax Saving**: Up to ₹46,800/year (at 30% tax bracket)

#### During Withdrawal Phase:
1. **PPF/SSY Maturity**: 
   - Completely tax-free withdrawal
   - No TDS, no reporting required
   
2. **Equity Mutual Funds**:
   - Withdraw up to ₹1.25 lakh gains per year = **ZERO TAX**
   - Plan redemptions across multiple years if corpus is large
   - Transfer units to child before sale (their ₹1.25 lakh exemption)
   
3. **International Funds**:
   - Use indexation benefit for long-term holdings
   - Harvest losses to offset gains
   - Spread redemptions across years

#### Pro Tip:
- After child turns 18-21, transfer mutual fund units to their name
- They get separate ₹1.25 lakh LTCG exemption
- Combine both parent and child exemptions = ₹2.5 lakh tax-free withdrawal yearly
