## 6. Tips for parents

1. **Start as early as possible** – even ₹5,000/month for 18 years can build a sizeable corpus.
2. **Increase SIP with salary** – add 5–10% every year or when you get a raise.
3. **Don’t stop in downturns** – SIP in equity funds works best when you continue through market falls.
4. **Review once a year** – check performance, risk, and whether the fund still fits your goal.
5. **Keep goal separate** – use a separate folio or tag for “kids education” so you don’t mix with other goals.
6. **Shift to safer options near goal** – 3–5 years before you need the money, consider moving part of the corpus to debt or hybrid funds to reduce volatility.
